# Electo

This app is build on concept of electtion/polling. Electo is built on Ruby on Rails(A full stack web development framework based on Ruby programming language).

I have used concept of social media feed to list out all elections running live or going to be live.

Electo is designed with keeping society, school, college, company, clubs and all kind of organisation in mind as they all organise elections time to time.

This app provides many features that reduces burden of manual convention election and paperwork.

Key features of this app are as follows,

1. Nominating candiate and election manager
2. Request approval work flow
3. Payment option to be a candidate
4. Restricting only limited and selected voter base
5. Feature to add CSV file for voter and only those voters can do vote for that specific election
6. Election scheduling at specific date and time
7. Results will be live when it ends according to scheduled time or manual termination
8. To maintain request/approval flow smoothly Action Cable is integrated to show live notifications
9. Group chat box is provided for each election so all voter/participant can talk to each other and ask any question to manager if any.
10. Chat box can be managed by manager. He/She can enable/disable chat box anytime.
11. A pleasent and simple UI/UX to maintain touchy user experience
and many more....
