# Electo

This app is build on concept of electtion/polling. Electo is built on Ruby on Rails(V6.0 with webpakcer)(A full stack web development framework based on Ruby programming language).

I have used concept of social media feed to list out all elections running live or going to be live.

Electo is designed with keeping society, school, college, company, clubs and all kind of organisation in mind as they all organise elections time to time.

This app provides many features that reduces burden of manual convention election and paperwork.

Key features of this app are as follows,

1. Login with Google and Facebook features for ease.
2. Nominating candiate and election manager.
3. Request approval work flow.
